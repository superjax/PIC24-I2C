# PIC24-I2C

I2C Driver written for the purpose of the BYU ME 495R Mechatronics Class by [gellings](https://github.com/gellings), [emros](https://github.com/emros), and [superjax](https://github.com/superjax).  This was written as the firmware for a robot capable of shooting ping-pong balls into a goal indicated by Infrared LED lights, and used two Wii-mote IR sensors like the those found [here](http://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=1088) to get position meaurements relative to the IR LED.

This repo is a stripped-down version of the code.  The full code and hardware schematics can be found [here](https://github.com/TeamBaymax), where this is meant to be a repo of the I2C driver and helper functions to drive the IR cameras.

Documentation can be found on this repo's [wiki](https://github.com/superjax/PIC24-I2C/wiki) (see right column of page)
